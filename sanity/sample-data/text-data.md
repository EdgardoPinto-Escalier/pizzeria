Paolo is the owner, he inherited the business from his late grandfather. Refers to himself as the master of pizza. He grows his own tomatoes and wonâ€™t let anyone else near them... a little odd but we like him.

After spending a summer in the city of Naples, Angela became passionate about Italian southern food. First it was pasta al dente, now it is pizza.

Some say Carlo is searching for the best ingredients, but in reality pizza isn't a passion, it's a paycheck. Deep down, Carlo is still trying to find himself.

Mario grows his own basil at home and brings it in. While he loves pizza, it pays the bills while he works on his hot sauce startup. Went his whole life calling the crust a "Pizza Border".

Laura runs an Etsy shop that sells hand-painted elephant ceramics customized based on your astrology sign. Judges you for ordering extra sauce.

Luigi played guitar in a rock band but was forced out due to creative differences. Claim to fame is that a picture of Luigi comes up first when you Google 'people enjoying Italian street foods'.

Giovanni went to Italy once. Will tell you how much better the pizza is 'over there'. He has no college debt.

Luca has a computer science degree but left the IT world to focus full-time on pizza, where he's developing a new kind of pizza toss (a very fast one where you do a flip)
